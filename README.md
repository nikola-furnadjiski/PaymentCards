# Casumo Frontend Developer Test

Casumo allows players to register multiple payment methods to make deposits easier.

## The Task

Your task is to implement a small app that helps users to add bank cards as payment methods.

The app should have three screens:

|  Screen  |                                                                        | Description              |
:--------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------- |
1          | <img src="./resources/screens/your-cards.png" width="150px" />         |  Show a list of the already registered bank cards. |
2          | <img src="./resources/screens/add-card-details.png" width="150px" />   |  Show a form for registering a new credit card. This form should appear when clicking the “Add new card” button.                         |
3          | <img src="./resources/screens/edit-card.png" width="150px" />          |  Show a form for editing an existing credit card. This form should appear when clicking on an existing credit card. |

## Form validation

The form for registering a new bank card has to validate if the card details are correct before submitting the form, or return an error otherwise.

|  State                                                                      | Description                                                              |
:---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
<img src="./resources/screens/add-card-details-success.png" width="150px" />  |  **Success:** <br> Show the successful state for the inputs according to the design. |
<img src="./resources/screens/add-card-details-error.png" width="150px" />    |  **Error:** <br> Show input validation errors according to the design. |

## The tools
Feel free to use whichever tools you like, although for the UI part we would prefer React.

Regarding persisting the data **we advise you not to build a backend service** for it but rather keep the data on the client.<br>
Use whichever data-layer you are comfortable with.
