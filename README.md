This is a simple Angular 17 app done as an interview assignment. <br> <br>
It contains the following Angular concepts: <br>
    - Angular components <br>
    - Scss styling <br>
    - Angular services <br>
    - angular-in-memory-web-api as a self-contained database on front-end side <br>
    - Http requests <br>
    - Observables <br>
    - Pipes (covered with unit tests) <br>
    - Models for the entities <br>
    - Enum for the types <br>
    - Angular reactive forms and form validation <br>
    - Assets <br>
    - Custom font <br>
    - Tailwind for styling of some parts of the app. <br>
<br>
In the app we have the functionalities to view our credit cards, to add a new card, to delete a card or edit a card.
Feel free to give it a try and experiment with it. <br>
